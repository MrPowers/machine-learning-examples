# Machine Learning Examples

Notebooks that show examples of machine learning problems.

Goal is to make all examples easily reproducible on your machine with clear conda environment setup instructions.

Notebooks should also be heavily annotated with text to provide context.

## Usage

You should use the conda `ml-examples` environment for all examples in this repo, unless otherwise noted.

Create the environment with this command: `conda create -f envs/ml-examples.yml`.

Activate the environment with `conda activate ml-examples`.

Open up the notebooks with `jupyter lab`.
